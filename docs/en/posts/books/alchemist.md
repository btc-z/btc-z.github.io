# The Alchemist

*by Paulo Coelho*

## Themes

1. Personal Legend: One's true calling; inner desire.
2. The Language of the World: Nature's silent voice cannot be expressed in words, only perceived through a quiet heart.
3. Value of Journey: During the journey we ourselves change; we are shaped by the travel itself. This is more important than the destination.
4. Love & Fulfillment: Love doesn't hinder dreams, but blesses their growth.


## Quotes

> There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.

Note: Living a life without knowing one's Personal Legend is more frightening than death. Fear of failure is the greatest obstacle preventing us from achieving our Personal Legend. Only the awareness of death can awaken our consciousness of life. Similar to Buddhism's concept of living towards death.

> The sea has lived on in this shell, because that's its Personal Legend. And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water.

Note: This passage is beautifully written. The sound of the sea forever echoes in the shell because this is its Personal Legend, until the sea covers the desert again. After we die, what matters is the sound of our traces echoing in this world. Only that sound is meaningful.

> It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.

Note: Despair always comes before dawn. Persisting in what the heart desires is the hardest thing to do.

> Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken millions of years to create it.

Note: This reminds me of the Avatamsaka Sutra's "In a single particle of dust, all worlds are seen." Things arise from the union of causes and conditions. Although a grain of sand is small, it interdepends with all things in the universe. Due to dependent origination and emptiness, it is also the universe.

> "There is only one way to learn," the alchemist answered. "It's through action."

Note: Recently reading Sartre's books, I was shocked by the so-called "existence precedes essence." Words and actions define our existence, and meaning itself is defined by behavior. Each of us must face our own solitude and bear full responsibility for giving life meaning. A person can claim to be generous, but only through generous actions does he truly become a generous person. A person can say they love you a hundred times, but are they willing to give their life for you?

> If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return. [...] If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil.

Note: Fleeting emotions leave nothing when you look back. But if that first glance was pure affection, then even after ten thousand lifetimes, that feeling will still be there. Pure things are eternal.

> "It's not what enters men's mouths that's evil," said the alchemist. "It's what comes out of their mouths that is."

Note: "Trouble comes from the mouth" - similar sentences exist in various cultures. The harm of language is real. Words can also leave bruises. Be careful not to hurt others with words.

> "Don't say anything," Fatima interrupted. "One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving"

Note: Does love need a reason? If love is pure, why do we need to explain why we like water? Why need to explain why we like sunlight? Why need to explain why we like warm wind?

> "Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure"

Note: Listen to your heart in silence, cultivate tranquility and reach far.

> "Every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world"

> "[...] people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want."

Note: Fear of the unknown prevents us from seeking what our heart desires.

> Sometimes there is just no way to hold back the river.

Note: Maktub. Many times we don't know why things happen. Whether it's karma, or the Creator's writing, everything is mysteriously connected, everything is destined to happen. The future that can be changed is the future that hasn't been determined yet, but sometimes we truly cannot stop the river.

> I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men

Note: We sink into beauty.

> "What's the world's greatest lie?" The boy asked, completely surprised.
> "It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie."

Note: Once again I hear the echo of Sartre's philosophy. The so-called destiny is the greatest lie. We must be responsible for our words and actions, and words and actions are defining life itself. I am my own god. Fear is the root of lies. Free will truly exists. Only truth is being alive.

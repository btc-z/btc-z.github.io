# The Ideal Life

Not caring for one's soul is like not caring for the roots of a tree. A tree without roots is merely getting by, merely existing.

Actually, I'm very fortunate to have my current job. I don't need to worry about money, my colleagues have good personalities, my boss is willing to shield us from difficulties, and shows empathy. This is perhaps the foundation that allows me to contemplate this question now. Otherwise, I wouldn't even know how to begin. I hope the following vision can be as free and imaginative as possible. Those limitations and constraints are actually layers of self-imposed fears, society's accumulated fears, self-stacked fears. In the end, what is truly impossible? Let me think of it differently — as if I'm writing from a dream or a parallel universe.

Morning, awakened by sunlight. Coffee naturally comes first. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, because most of the time I wake up hungry. The philosophy of work itself is perhaps that feeling of being eager to start, rather than "oh, I have to start." Or rather, the philosophy of work is: what can I learn today? What I learned yesterday seems to have new insights, and finally there's a chance to try it out. Of course it would be good to have comrades to study together; otherwise, challenging problems are bound to be too lonely.

Lunch — I like to eat simply, but I enjoy talking about non-work topics with those who tackle problems together. Because this is the only opportunity to see who they are without their work masks. People who wear work masks all day actually scare me, because I cannot see them. What cannot be seen are dangers in the darkness, instinct tells me.

I like to reserve afternoon time for completing trivial work. Of course, when inefficient, I go rest or read, go for a walk, go think about the next most important, most challenging, most valuable problem to solve. The time waiting for sunset is actually a process of preparing for the night, and also preparing for the arrival of the next day. Night will always come, the stomach will eventually get hungry. I want to have dinner with family or friends. Rather than watching TV, I prefer to chat cheerfully while eating. Maybe because I like the campfire tribal culture? Around the campfire, everyone can talk about their fantasies, their fears, their curiosity, thirst for knowledge, and desires. Isn't the purpose of stories to be a mirror?

Night is beautiful, but a night without stars, without insect songs, without singing, without echoes of long howls in the valley — is such a life worth living? A night with only thinking but no feeling — is it worth spending? Like light and shadow, they need to coexist, like tree roots and branches.

Solitary time is reserved for oneself. Bodily solitude is the soil that allows the spirit to rest. Only by nurturing the soul can you dialogue with it. When we fall into dreams, what are we really dreaming? After waking, those worlds we no longer remember, those people — who are they? Aren't the stories between us and them worth anticipating? That is truly your own world. A person's spiritual world cannot be defiled. Dreams are purely and utterly yours. It is your true room, it is the place that truly allows you to cry for yourself.

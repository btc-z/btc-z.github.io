# Ten Days of Meditation

## "The Sea of Inhalation and Exhalation"

In the sea of inhalation and exhalation, there is a small boat. Through night and day, it sails forward.

Consciousness is as ethereal as the sea breeze, yet as soft as a jellyfish.

The tendrils of consciousness glide like threads over the boat's body, stamping across it like seals, wrapping around the hull like an octopus, and sometimes climbing and coiling like spirulina.

The boat has sailed through eighty thousand long nights, and in these eighty thousand nights, eighty thousand poems have echoed.

Consciousness moves between bow and stern to a rhythm — sometimes urgent, sometimes slow; sometimes rough, sometimes subtle; sometimes hot, sometimes cold; sometimes compressed, sometimes torn; sometimes restless, sometimes itchy; sometimes pulsing, sometimes void; sometimes trembling, sometimes calm.

In the poems, an unrelated note sometimes jumps out. This note is sometimes strong, sometimes weak, but this abrupt tone eventually fades into the flow of the poem, like ripples in water that were never there.

The most difficult thing for the boat may be that the waves vary in intensity and rhythm, and to sail smoothly, it must treat them all equally. Some waves are mixed with greed, some carry disgust, some are wrapped in arrogance. And "the past" has branded various marks on the hull — large waves make the boat anxious to seek harbor, turbulent waves make it want to steer away quickly. But there is no harbor in the sea of inhalation and exhalation, there are no waves to avoid in the sea of inhalation and exhalation. In the sea of inhalation and exhalation, there is only the boat and the waves.

Fortunately, all this turbulence will pass, because no matter how the past has battered the hull, there is a sail that drives the boat forward. This is a very special sail. In the sail are love, hate, emotions, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. In the sail are glory and loneliness. Stitch by stitch, the sail is woven with the boat's stories, the boat's past, the boat's tears and blood. In this sail are both the deep nights of solitude and the wandering dawns. This sail is very small — in the vast sea of inhalation and exhalation, as tiny as a speck of dust. This sail is very large — on the small boat, it seems to be the boat's everything. In this sail are a thousand autumns past and a hundred generations future.

As the boat sails day by day on the sea of inhalation and exhalation, the sea gradually quiets down. Although there are still occasional ripples, most of the time the surface is more like a lake, so calm that reflections can be seen. Perhaps this is the purpose of the boat coming here — it has traveled so many routes yet has never seen itself.

## "The Silent Sea"

In the silent sea floats a silent boat. The boat's sensations still shuttle between fast and slow across the hull. Gradually, parts that were previously unfelt become vivid, and consciousness glides more smoothly. The keel melts into water, the boat melts into water.

It turns out that the boat is consciousness, and consciousness is the boat. And the boat, like consciousness, is flowing, is soft, and not imprisoned.

The silent sea, without a trace of wind, only has waves of consciousness trembling, like the silent roar of life.

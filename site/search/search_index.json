We chose Fulcrum instead of other implementations based on the Server Performance Guide.</p> <p>Fulcrum performs a full index on Bitcoin transactions, which is something Bitcoin Core itself doesn\u2019t do. Therefore, using a Fulcrum as a Private Electrum Server makes sure that outsiders don\u2019t know what your address(es) are.</p> <p>After Fulcrum finishes indexing, which took about 2 days on my old Mac, we would see something like the below:</p> <p></p> <p>Similar to how we tested the Bitcoin Core connection, now navigate to the Electrum Private Server tab and tap Test Connection.</p> <p></p> <p>We see that the connection to the Fulcrum 1.9.0 server was successful.</p> <p>At this point, your Sparrow wallet is safe to use!

The best answer I have heard is from \"is it possible to brute force bitcoin address creation in order to steal money?\": it is simply much cheaper to mine than to hack as hacking takes tremendously more processing power.</p> <p>Inside any Bitcoin wallet, you have an extremely large number of Bitcoin addresses for this reason. Consequently, it is highly recommended to never re-use Bitcoin addresses. Sparrow conveniently refreshes a new receive address automatically so that each receive address is only associated with a single transaction.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown in the above image, I have tested sending a small amount of Bitcoin from my mobile BlueWallet to COLDCARD, and also from Binance to my COLDCARD. Sparrow allows users to label addresses, conveniently.</p> <p>When a transaction is broadcasted from my BlueWallet or Binance, it will take on average 10 minutes to have 1 confirmation. After 6 confirmations, the transaction is then assumed to be secure. Why 6? because at that point, it becomes nearly impossible to mess around with that transaction anymore. What does this mean to you? When you receive a Bitcoin, wait for about an hour (10 minutes / per confirmation, so 6 confirmations in an hour) before you treat that transaction as final.</p>"},{"location":"posts/bitcoin/self_custody/#send-bitcoin","title":"Send Bitcoin","text":"<p>In the Send tab, you can create a transaction by filling in</p> <ol> <li>(required) Pay To address (use QR scan if possible to avoid incorrect typing of address)</li> <li>(required) amount in sats or BTC</li> <li>(optional) label: to record this transaction</li> <li>(optional) select fee: if you don\u2019t like the default fee, you can adjust the fee depending on how soon you want it to be completed.

A healthy trifecta of these three is absolutely essential for a free society to flourish.

Fear of failure is the greatest obstacle preventing us from achieving our Personal Legend. Only the awareness of death can awaken our consciousness of life. Similar to Buddhism's concept of living towards death.</p> <p>The sea has lived on in this shell, because that's its Personal Legend. And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water.</p> <p>Note: This passage is beautifully written. The sound of the sea forever echoes in the shell because this is its Personal Legend, until the sea covers the desert again. After we die, what matters is the sound of our traces echoing in this world. Only that sound is meaningful.</p> <p>It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.</p> <p>Note: Despair always comes before dawn. Persisting in what the heart desires is the hardest thing to do.</p> <p>Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken millions of years to create it.</p> <p>Note: This reminds me of the Avatamsaka Sutra's \"In a single particle of dust, all worlds are seen.\" Things arise from the union of causes and conditions. Although a grain of sand is small, it interdepends with all things in the universe. Due to dependent origination and emptiness, it is also the universe.</p> <p>\"There is only one way to learn,\" the alchemist answered. \"It's through action.\"</p> <p>Note: Recently reading Sartre's books, I was shocked by the so-called \"existence precedes essence.\" Words and actions define our existence, and meaning itself is defined by behavior. Each of us must face our own solitude and bear full responsibility for giving life meaning. A person can claim to be generous, but only through generous actions does he truly become a generous person. A person can say they love you a hundred times, but are they willing to give their life for you?</p> <p>If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return. [...] If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil.</p> <p>Note: Fleeting emotions leave nothing when you look back. But if that first glance was pure affection, then even after ten thousand lifetimes, that feeling will still be there. Pure things are eternal.</p> <p>\"It's not what enters men's mouths that's evil,\" said the alchemist. \"It's what comes out of their mouths that is.\"</p> <p>Note: \"Trouble comes from the mouth\" - similar sentences exist in various cultures. The harm of language is real. Words can also leave bruises. Be careful not to hurt others with words.</p> <p>\"Don't say anything,\" Fatima interrupted. \"One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving\"</p> <p>Note: Does love need a reason? If love is pure, why do we need to explain why we like water? Why need to explain why we like sunlight? Why need to explain why we like warm wind?</p> <p>\"Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure\"</p> <p>Note: Listen to your heart in silence, cultivate tranquility and reach far.</p> <p>\"Every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world\"</p> <p>\"[...] people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.\"</p> <p>Note: Fear of the unknown prevents us from seeking what our heart desires.</p> <p>Sometimes there is just no way to hold back the river.</p> <p>Note: Maktub. Many times we don't know why things happen. Whether it's karma, or the Creator's writing, everything is mysteriously connected, everything is destined to happen. The future that can be changed is the future that hasn't been determined yet, but sometimes we truly cannot stop the river.</p> <p>I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men</p> <p>Note: We sink into beauty.</p> <p>\"What's the world's greatest lie?\" The boy asked, completely surprised. \"It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie.\"</p> <p>Note: Once again I hear the echo of Sartre's philosophy. The so-called destiny is the greatest lie. We must be responsible for our words and actions, and words and actions are defining life itself. I am my own god. Fear is the root of lies. Free will truly exists. Only truth is being alive.</p>"},{"location":"en/posts/reflections/ideal-life/","title":"The Ideal Life","text":"<p>Not caring for one's soul is like not caring for the roots of a tree. A tree without roots is merely getting by, merely existing.</p> <p>Actually, I'm very fortunate to have my current job. I don't need to worry about money, my colleagues have good personalities, my boss is willing to shield us from difficulties, and shows empathy. This is perhaps the foundation that allows me to contemplate this question now. Otherwise, I wouldn't even know how to begin. I hope the following vision can be as free and imaginative as possible. Those limitations and constraints are actually layers of self-imposed fears, society's accumulated fears, self-stacked fears. In the end, what is truly impossible? Let me think of it differently \u2014 as if I'm writing from a dream or a parallel universe.</p> <p>Morning, awakened by sunlight. Coffee naturally comes first. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, because most of the time I wake up hungry. The philosophy of work itself is perhaps that feeling of being eager to start, rather than \"oh, I have to start.\" Or rather, the philosophy of work is: what can I learn today? What I learned yesterday seems to have new insights, and finally there's a chance to try it out. Of course it would be good to have comrades to study together; otherwise, challenging problems are bound to be too lonely.</p> <p>Lunch \u2014 I like to eat simply, but I enjoy talking about non-work topics with those who tackle problems together. Because this is the only opportunity to see who they are without their work masks. People who wear work masks all day actually scare me, because I cannot see them. What cannot be seen are dangers in the darkness, instinct tells me.</p> <p>I like to reserve afternoon time for completing trivial work. Of course, when inefficient, I go rest or read, go for a walk, go think about the next most important, most challenging, most valuable problem to solve. The time waiting for sunset is actually a process of preparing for the night, and also preparing for the arrival of the next day. Night will always come, the stomach will eventually get hungry. I want to have dinner with family or friends. Rather than watching TV, I prefer to chat cheerfully while eating. Maybe because I like the campfire tribal culture? Around the campfire, everyone can talk about their fantasies, their fears, their curiosity, thirst for knowledge, and desires. Isn't the purpose of stories to be a mirror?</p> <p>Night is beautiful, but a night without stars, without insect songs, without singing, without echoes of long howls in the valley \u2014 is such a life worth living? A night with only thinking but no feeling \u2014 is it worth spending? Like light and shadow, they need to coexist, like tree roots and branches.</p> <p>Solitary time is reserved for oneself. Bodily solitude is the soil that allows the spirit to rest. Only by nurturing the soul can you dialogue with it. When we fall into dreams, what are we really dreaming? After waking, those worlds we no longer remember, those people \u2014 who are they? Aren't the stories between us and them worth anticipating? That is truly your own world. A person's spiritual world cannot be defiled. Dreams are purely and utterly yours. It is your true room, it is the place that truly allows you to cry for yourself.</p>"},{"location":"en/posts/reflections/the-sea-of-breathing/","title":"Ten Days of Meditation","text":""},{"location":"en/posts/reflections/the-sea-of-breathing/#the-sea-of-inhalation-and-exhalation","title":"\"The Sea of Inhalation and Exhalation\"","text":"<p>In the sea of inhalation and exhalation, there is a small boat. Through night and day, it sails forward.</p> <p>Consciousness is as ethereal as the sea breeze, yet as soft as a jellyfish.</p> <p>The tendrils of consciousness glide like threads over the boat's body, stamping across it like seals, wrapping around the hull like an octopus, and sometimes climbing and coiling like spirulina.</p> <p>The boat has sailed through eighty thousand long nights, and in these eighty thousand nights, eighty thousand poems have echoed.</p> <p>Consciousness moves between bow and stern to a rhythm \u2014 sometimes urgent, sometimes slow; sometimes rough, sometimes subtle; sometimes hot, sometimes cold; sometimes compressed, sometimes torn; sometimes restless, sometimes itchy; sometimes pulsing, sometimes void; sometimes trembling, sometimes calm.</p> <p>In the poems, an unrelated note sometimes jumps out. This note is sometimes strong, sometimes weak, but this abrupt tone eventually fades into the flow of the poem, like ripples in water that were never there.</p> <p>The most difficult thing for the boat may be that the waves vary in intensity and rhythm, and to sail smoothly, it must treat them all equally. Some waves are mixed with greed, some carry disgust, some are wrapped in arrogance. And \"the past\" has branded various marks on the hull \u2014 large waves make the boat anxious to seek harbor, turbulent waves make it want to steer away quickly. But there is no harbor in the sea of inhalation and exhalation, there are no waves to avoid in the sea of inhalation and exhalation. In the sea of inhalation and exhalation, there is only the boat and the waves.</p> <p>Fortunately, all this turbulence will pass, because no matter how the past has battered the hull, there is a sail that drives the boat forward. This is a very special sail. In the sail are love, hate, emotions, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. In the sail are glory and loneliness. Stitch by stitch, the sail is woven with the boat's stories, the boat's past, the boat's tears and blood. In this sail are both the deep nights of solitude and the wandering dawns. This sail is very small \u2014 in the vast sea of inhalation and exhalation, as tiny as a speck of dust. This sail is very large \u2014 on the small boat, it seems to be the boat's everything. In this sail are a thousand autumns past and a hundred generations future.</p> <p>As the boat sails day by day on the sea of inhalation and exhalation, the sea gradually quiets down. Although there are still occasional ripples, most of the time the surface is more like a lake, so calm that reflections can be seen. Perhaps this is the purpose of the boat coming here \u2014 it has traveled so many routes yet has never seen itself.</p>"},{"location":"en/posts/reflections/the-sea-of-breathing/#the-silent-sea","title":"\"The Silent Sea\"","text":"<p>In the silent sea floats a silent boat.
